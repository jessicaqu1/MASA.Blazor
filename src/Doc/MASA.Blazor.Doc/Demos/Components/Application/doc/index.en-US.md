In `MASA Blazor`, the App properties on the `MApp` component and `MNavigationDrawer`, `MAppBar`, `MFooter` and other components help your application to adjust the size of the `MMain` component appropriately. This allows you to create truly unique interfaces without worrying about managing layout sizes. All applications need the `MApp` component. This is the mount point for many `MASA Blazor` components and functions, and ensures that it passes the default application theme (Dark/Light) to the child components, and ensures the correct cross-browser support for certain click events in the browser .
